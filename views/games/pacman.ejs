        <p class="mt-3">This pacman game has the original Pacman game and a multiplayer Mrs Pacman spin-off. The ghosts in the game have been programmed to have the same behaviour of the original ghosts. The only exception is they are not programmed to return to their corners.<br>
          <br>The Mrs Pacman game can be played by two people. To make it more challenging for two players to complete the level, I decided to double the amount of ghosts.<br>
          <br>I sourced Pacman sprites off of the internet, but all the programming was done by me in Visual Studio Forms.</p>
