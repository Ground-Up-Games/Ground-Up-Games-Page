        <p class="mt-3">Comes with three games based on Atari Classics. Each game has a unique twist to make it my own. The first game has powerups and enemies for the player to hit with the ball and paddle. The second game has bullets and weapons the player can fire at the bomb enemies and the last game has a human body and bacteria theme.<br>
          <br>This project was designed for me to become familiar with developing games for Android using Unity. It was also a challenge to manage time effectively trying to work on multiple mini games.<br>
          <br>Made with Unity. All sprites and sounds are original and made by me. The game is currently available on the Google Play store. The link is on the downloads page.</p>
